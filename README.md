# prime-numbers
The objective of this program is simple. To find prime numbers as fast as possible. I originally developed this algorithm in python. However, I would really like to know how efficient it is. The program is very lightweight, aproximately 700 bytes and only requires one dependancy to run: `pip install bitarray`. I propose two solutions. main.py is the least efficient but the most fair. It analyzes each and every number from 2 to the length of the array until turning every possible factor into false. optimal.py works fairly similar but already knows that every multiple of 2 is not a prime number, so starts with 3 as a factor. This makes optimal.py two times as fast in calculating prime numbers up to 10,000,000. Nevertheless, I am not sure how valid it is to to do this. I think it is a nice experiment and I am looking forward to developing this in C#. I would like to know your opinions.
